        <h2>YES<span style="color: #131b24;"><strong> </strong></span></h2>

    <div>
        <p>Practicing yoga can increase blood oxygen levels. This is because many yoga practices involve deep breathing exercises, which can help improve lung capacity and oxygen exchange in the body..</p>

        <h2><strong>How it works ?</strong></h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>During deep breathing exercises in yoga, you inhale deeply and slowly, filling your lungs with oxygen. This allows more oxygen to enter the bloodstream and be carried to the body's cells, which can help improve energy levels, reduce fatigue, and promote overall health.</p>
        <p>In addition, practicing yoga can also help improve cardiovascular function and blood circulation, which can further increase oxygen delivery to the body's tissues and organs.</p>

        <h2>how to measure blood oxygen level ?
            </h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>The blood oxygen level can be measured using a device called a pulse oximeter. Pulse oximeters are non-invasive and can be easily used at home.</p>
        
        <p> A normal SpO2 reading is between 95% and 100%. If your reading is lower than 95%, it could indicate a problem with your breathing or oxygenation. In this case, you should contact your doctor for further evaluation.</p>
