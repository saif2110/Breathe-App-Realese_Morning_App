    <h2>How old breathe yoga is ?</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
    <p>The practice of yoga dates back to ancient India, with roots in the Indus Valley Civilization around 3000 BCE. However, the specific practice of pranayama, or breath control, which is an integral part of many yoga practices, has been around for even longer.</p>
    <p>The origins of pranayama can be traced back to the Vedic period in India, which dates back to around 1500 BCE. The ancient texts known as the Upanishads describe pranayama as a way to control the breath in order to calm the mind and prepare for meditation..&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>So, while it is difficult to determine exactly how old the specific practice of breath control in yoga is, it is safe to say that it has been a part of yoga for thousands of years.&nbsp;</p>

    <h2><strong>Oxygen level and heart rate are always linked ?</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>False:&nbsp;</strong>While oxygen level and heart rate are related, they are not always directly linked. Oxygen level refers to the amount of oxygen that is present in the blood, while heart rate refers to the number of times the heart beats per minute.
    <br>
    
        The heart's main function is to pump blood throughout the body, which carries oxygen to the cells. The heart rate increases when the body requires more oxygen, such as during exercise or when the oxygen levels in the blood are low.</p>
